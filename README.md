# SoundRedux

In an effort to learn es6 and [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), this is SoundRedux, a simple [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com) client

See it in action at https://soundredux.io

Uses [normalizr](https://github.com/gaearon/normalizr)

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`
3. visit `http://localhost:8080`

### Install local server

To see user authentication in action in your local environment, install and run the server.

1. Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/) installed.
2. Make sure the `sound-redux` folder is in your `$GOPATH`
3. `$ cd server`
4. `$ go get .`
5. `$ go install .`

Once installed you can run the server:
`$ server`

Feedback, issues, etc. are more than welcome!
