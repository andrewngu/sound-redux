# SoundRedux

In an effort to learn es6 and [redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux), this is SoundRedux, a simple [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com) client

See it in action at http://soundredux.io

Todo: use [normalizr](https://github.com/gaearon/normalizr) for less data duplication

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`
3. visit `http://localhost:8080`

Feedback, issues, etc. are more than welcome!
